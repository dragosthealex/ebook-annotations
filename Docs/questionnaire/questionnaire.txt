Aim:
To understand whether the developed application would be found useful
by users, and if it would be perceived to solve a problem / improve a feature
over current technologies.

Structure:
The questions are designed to tackle 8 main issues plus a suggestion box. Most questions
are closed, multiple choice - single answer. Some of them are mixed, having multiple possible
answers and an "other" open field. The number of fully open questions is limited, as it has been
shown most people leave those fields blank if they are not required, and if they are marked as
required, it might cause people abandoning the survey.
